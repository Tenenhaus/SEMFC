Description: We propose an R package for Structural Equation Modeling with factors and composites within the framework of the basic design. We implement SVD-SEM which relies on a non-iterative SVD-based algorithm for parameter estimation, producing consistent and asymptotically normal estimators, offering a statistically and computationally sound alternative to PLS-SEM. Additionally, we implement the restricted maximum-likelihood approach (RML-SEM) for the basic design with factors and composites. SVD-SEM can serve as an initial solution for RML-SEM.
