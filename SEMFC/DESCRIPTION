Description: We propose an R package for Structural Equation Modeling with 
factors and composites within the framework of the basic design. 
We implement SVD-SEM which relies on a non-iterative SVD-based 
algorithm for parameter estimation, producing consistent and asymptotically 
normal estimators, offering a statistically and computationally sound 
alternative to PLS-SEM. Additionally, we implement the restricted maximum-likelihood 
approach (RML-SEM) for the basic design with factors and composites. SVD-SEM 
can serve as an initial solution for RML-SEM.
